### This is a project that was with the intention for DOT.

Our own ASR with trasnformers Neural Networks for DOT, the 
problem was the Dataset, it contains only 500 hours for training
"Librispeech clean 360 and 100", you can see the model in kaggle.

To make a model like Google's ASR, you will need more than 10000 hours
for training, there's a lib called GigaSpeech that contains more than
10000 hours, but is more than 1Tb, you will need to have a better
pc, at least 1 epoch is going to take 12 or more hours.

But the model at the end works perfect:)

the model.model only contains 100 epochs of training with a loss
aprox of 0.65
